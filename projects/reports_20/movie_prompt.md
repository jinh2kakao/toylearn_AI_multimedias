## Scene 1: 질문을 던지다 (0-8초)
Shot Type: Ultra close-up tracking shot / Slow push-in shot

Scene Description:

The scene opens with an ultra close-up on a single, ordinary dust motes dancing in a narrow shaft of sunlight, cutting through a dimly lit, cozy room. The camera begins a slow, deliberate push-in, revealing the worn spine of a book titled "Flotsam" (or just a stylized, intriguing cover if the title is not directly visible). The book sits on an antique wooden bookshelf, amidst other generic, slightly faded books. As the camera very slowly inches closer to "Flotsam," a subtle, otherworldly shimmer of bioluminescent blue-green light begins to pulse softly from between its closed pages. This ethereal glow subtly illuminates the surrounding dust particles and casts a delicate, magical aura on the adjacent books and the wooden shelf. The light isn't overtly fantastical but hints at something profound contained within. The dust motes continue their dance, oblivious to the hidden magic. The focus remains tack sharp on the book as the light intensifies ever so slightly.

The scene opens with a gentle, slow push-in shot, revealing a charmingly cozy living room entirely submerged underwater. The room is designed with human-like furniture: a floral patterned armchair and a matching sofa, a round coffee table with an old-fashioned fishbowl, and two classic floor lamps, all subtly swaying with the gentle currents.

The central figure is a medium-sized blue octopus, comfortably nestled in the armchair. It is engrossed in reading a slightly waterlogged book, its eyes occasionally darting across the pages. One of its tentacles gently turns a page, while another absentmindedly taps the armrest.

Around the room, smaller blue octopuses are engaged in various leisurely activities:

On the matching sofa, a slightly larger octopus is lounging contentedly, its tentacles draped casually. It occasionally yawns or stretches.

Near the coffee table, a tiny baby octopus is curiously exploring the fishbowl, its small tentacles gently tapping the glass, sending ripples through the water inside the bowl. It might briefly make eye contact with the camera.

Another small octopus is playfully rolling a pebble or a tiny shell on the patterned rug below the table, its movements graceful and fluid.

Tiny, colorful fish swim casually past the "windows" of this underwater room, some even darting momentarily into the lampshades, causing a subtle flicker of the warm, yellow light. Small, shimmering air bubbles occasionally float upwards from various corners of the room.

The lighting is warm and inviting, emanating from the lamps (with a soft, golden glow) and diffused through the ambient blue of the water. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, slightly humorous, and incredibly charming, capturing the whimsical domesticity of an octopus family's day.

A detailed black and white sketch animation opens on an underwater scene. Two large, ornate seahorses dominate the background, surrounded by various fish and coral formations, all rendered in a consistent sketch style. In the midground, a sleek, flat spaceship rests on the ocean floor, or perhaps just above it. Numerous small, adorable aliens in classic bubble helmets are scattered around the scene: some are sitting on the spaceship, others are riding fish, and a few are standing on the seabed interacting with each other. Bubbles drift upwards from the ocean floor. The animation captures the gentle sway of the seahorses and coral, the subtle movements of the fish, and the curious, playful actions of the aliens as they explore their underwater surroundings. The sketch lines are crisp, and shading provides depth and texture to the entire scene.

A fantastical black and white sketch animation opens on a turbulent ocean with intricately drawn, rolling waves. The camera pans up to reveal a large, round pufferfish floating serenely above the water like a hot air balloon, complete with a small basket hanging beneath it. Bubbles gently rise from the pufferfish as it bobs in the air.

The camera continues its ascent, moving past the pufferfish to reveal a magnificent, giant sea turtle gliding gracefully through a sky filled with soft clouds. An entire whimsical city, filled with detailed castles, towers, and mushroom-shaped buildings, rests upon its back. The turtle's flippers move slowly and majestically. In the background, other smaller turtles carrying their own cities can be seen flying in the distance. The entire scene is animated in a consistent black and white sketch style, with detailed line work and subtle shading to create a sense of depth and wonder.

The scene opens on a serene, sandy ocean floor, animated in a detailed pencil sketch style. The camera performs an extremely slow and smooth dolly-in (push-in shot), gradually moving closer towards the central subject: an old, vintage-style camera. The camera is heavily encrusted with barnacles, small corals, and bits of dark green seaweed that grow from its crevices, all meticulously drawn. Its metallic body shows signs of long submersion, yet the large glass lens, though ancient, seems to hold a strange, almost magical clarity, reflecting the distorted underwater world around it with subtle sketch-based refractions. Beautiful, ethereal god rays are depicted as softly shaded beams of light filtering down from the rippling water surface far above. These beams of light shift, shimmer, and gently dance across the seafloor and the camera, their movement indicating the subtle motion of the waves above, all rendered through animated shading and lines. A steady, slow stream of tiny, shimmering air bubbles rises from a small opening on the top of the camera, animated with delicate, floating circles. The seaweed attached to the camera sways gently in a slow, invisible current. Particles of marine snow drift lazily throughout the frame, enhancing the sense of depth and tranquility. As the camera gets closer, a small, curious, translucent glass shrimp might scuttle across the sand, pause to investigate the camera's lens with its antennae, and then move on out of frame, all through subtle animation. The overall atmosphere is one of profound quiet, nostalgia, and a deep, unspoken mystery, brought to life through elegant, monochrome hand-drawn animation.
