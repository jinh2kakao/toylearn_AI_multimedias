[Master Prompt]
(Shot Type): A breathtaking, cinematic wide shot, transitioning into a dynamic zoom.

(Setting): The scene is set on a lush green hill overlooking a wide river, bathed in the warm, golden light of the setting sun. The sky is a clear, vast gradient of orange and blue. In the distance, the silhouette of a modern city skyline and a bridge is visible across the water.

(Characters):

A: A young East Asian girl in a school uniform.

B: A sleek, white humanoid AI robot.

(Action Sequence):

(0 to 3 seconds): The girl (A) and the robot (B) stand together, skillfully flying a colorful traditional Korean kite. The girl holds the reel with a look of pure joy, while the robot assists, its metallic hands expertly guiding the string. The kite catches a gentle breeze and soars higher and further into the expansive sunset sky.

(4 to 6 seconds): The camera executes a smooth but rapid zoom, traveling along the line of the kite string. The focus dramatically shifts from the wide landscape to the kite itself, which fills the screen in a vibrant close-up against the beautiful golden sky.
