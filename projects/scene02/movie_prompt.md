```[Master Prompt]
(Shot Type): A clean, cinematic medium wide shot. The camera is static, capturing the entire entryway.

(Setting): A brightly lit and modern apartment entryway with clean white walls and a polished tile floor. A sleek, white front door is equipped with a futuristic digital door lock. To the left of the door, a black stand holds a white umbrella.

(Character): An East Asian teenage girl dressed in a school uniform, wearing a backpack and looking like she is in a hurry to leave.

(Action Sequence):

(0 to 2 seconds): The girl reaches for the digital door lock to open the door. As her fingers touch the lock, it emits a soft, blue light that travels down the door frame to the floor. Simultaneously, a glowing blue holographic interface projects onto the tile floor at her feet, vividly displaying an animated icon of a cloud with falling rain.

(3 to 8 seconds): She pauses mid-action, her hand still on the handle, and her gaze drops to the weather hologram. Her expression shifts from hurriedness to a moment of surprised realization. She gives a small sigh, retracts her hand, turns around, and decisively grabs the white umbrella from the stand.
