[Master Prompt]
(Shot Type): A breathtaking, cinematic wide shot, transitioning to a dynamic zoom.

(Background): This scene is set on a green hill overlooking a wide river, bathed in warm, golden light as the sunset unfolds. The sky is a clear, expansive gradient of orange and blue. In the distance, a modern city skyline and bridge can be seen across the water.

(Characters):

A: A young East Asian girl in a school uniform.

B: A sleek, white, humanoid AI robot.

(Action Sequence):

(0-3 seconds): A girl (A) and a robot (B) stand together, skillfully flying a colorful, traditional Korean kite. The girl holds the kite with an expression of pure joy, while the robot assists, expertly manipulating it with its metal hands. The kite soars higher and further into the vast sky, carried by the gentle breeze.

Animate the scene based on the image prompt. In a bright and happy Two-Shot, the young girl and the AI robot are joyfully managing a kite reel together. The girl is laughing out loud, her head tilted back slightly in exhilaration. The AI robot turns its head to look at the laughing girl, its facial visor glowing a little brighter. Their hands work in sync to turn the reel. The girl's ponytail should sway in the wind. The camera remains stable, focusing on their happy interaction.

Animate a 5-second video clip based on the image prompt's description of a bright and happy Two-Shot.

Primary Action: The scene focuses on the shared joy between the girl and the AI robot as they control the kite.

Character Animation:

The young girl looks up towards the (off-screen) kite, then turns to the robot with a wide, genuine laugh. Her whole body expresses exhilaration. Her hands are actively turning the kite reel. The "catchlight" in her eyes should sparkle as she moves.

The AI robot's movements are smooth and subtle. It gently assists with the reel, then its head turns towards the laughing girl. Its blue facial visor pulses with a slightly brighter, warmer light, mimicking a smile and conveying a sense of shared happiness. The sharp reflections on its chassis should shift realistically with its movements.

Environmental Animation:

A gentle breeze makes the girl's hair and t-shirt flutter naturally.

The blades of grass in the immediate foreground sway slightly.

The camera is stable, holding the Two-Shot to capture their emotional connection. The bright midday sun lighting should be maintained throughout.
Style: photorealistic, 8K, high detail, cheerful and energetic.

Animate a 5-second video clip based on the image prompt's description of an Over-the-Shoulder shot.

Camera Perspective: The camera is positioned low and just behind the shoulders of the girl and the robot, making the viewer feel like a part of their shared moment.

Primary Action: The focus is on the vastness of the sky and the kite's lively, natural movement within it.

Object & Environmental Animation:

The kite, now a small but distinct shape against the deep blue sky, dances with the invisible currents of the wind. It doesn't just drift; it flutters, occasionally dipping slightly before catching an updraft and soaring higher. The kite sways from side to side in a gentle, unpredictable rhythm. The long tails of the kite trail behind, whipping and flowing gracefully with each movement.

Fluffy white clouds drift slowly and majestically across the frame, creating a sense of scale and passing time.

The sunlight should create a subtle, shimmering effect on the surface of the distant Han River.

Character Animation (Subtle):

From behind, we see the girl's ponytail and t-shirt fluttering gently in the breeze. She might shift her weight slightly, fully absorbed in the sight.

The AI robot remains perfectly steady, a symbol of unwavering focus and support beside her. The clean reflections on its back shift slightly with the moving clouds.

The overall mood is peaceful, hopeful, and filled with a sense of infinite possibility. The camera remains stable to let the viewer soak in the atmosphere.
Style: photorealistic, 8K, cinematic, vast and inspiring.
