Basic Prompt (기본 프롬프트)
A full-body shot of Jiho, a curious and kind 8-year-old Korean boy. He has short black hair and large, round glasses that frame his intelligent, sparkling eyes. He is wearing a simple blue t-shirt, as seen in the storybook illustration. Jiho is in his grandfather's dusty but sunlit attic, holding an old tablet that emits a soft magical glow. His expression is one of joyful discovery, realizing he might be a "coding wizard". The art style is a warm and gentle 2D animation with a hand-drawn feel, reminiscent of the storybook's cover.
