캐릭터 1. 전문가 토끼

This image captures the interior of what appears to be a radio or podcast studio, rendered in a clean, animated style. The room is dimly lit, suggesting an evening or controlled lighting environment, and features a warm color palette of wood tones, blues, and grays.

In the foreground, a light brown, circular desk with a dark gray edge occupies the left side of the frame. On this desk, a black microphone with a gray windscreen is right placed, attached to a short stand. On this desk, a black microphone with a gray windscreen is left placed, attached to a short stand. To the beetween of the microphone, a small, light brown control panel with several black knobs and buttons, and a gauge, is visible. . A pair of black over-ear headphones rests on the desk just in front of the mixer, with a coiled wire connecting it to the audio equipment.

To the right of the desk, a blue office chair with black armrests is positioned, facing away from the viewer. The chair has a simple, modern design with a slightly textured fabric.

The background of the room features walls paneled with a rich, dark reddish-brown wood up to about waist height, topped with a lighter, muted blue-gray wall section. There are two dark, rectangular windows on the back wall, suggesting soundproofing or a view into another room, but their interiors are completely black. Between these two windows, on the blue-gray wall section, a framed monitor or screen is mounted. The screen displays a grid of four panels, each showing what looks like a different video feed or graphic, with two of the panels appearing to show human figures or faces, though not clearly discernible.

The overall impression is one of a functional and well-equipped broadcast space, designed for clear audio production.

캐릭터 2. 아나운서 여우

This full-frame, digitally rendered portrait showcases an anthropomorphic fox from the waist up, set against a smooth, dark gradient background that transitions from charcoal gray at the top to a slightly lighter gray at the bottom. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the subject.

The fox has vibrant orange fur with white accents. Its face is round with large, expressive, emerald green eyes that have dark pupils and a subtle sparkle. The eyelids are lined with a dark color, and thin, dark eyebrows are arched gently above the eyes. The nose is a small, dark, triangular button. The snout and muzzle area are white, contrasting with the orange fur around its eyes and forehead. Its ears are prominent, triangular, and stand upright, with white fur on the inside and orange fur on the outside, edged with dark fur.

The fox is wearing a white, short-sleeved dress with a slightly puffed sleeve design, creating a gentle ruffle texture. The dress has a subtle plaid or grid-like pattern embossed into the fabric, which is visible across the bodice and sleeves. The neckline is a simple, rounded style. The fur on its chest is also white, visible above the dress. Its hands, which are also covered in orange fur, are clasped gently in front of its body, resting on the dress. A fluffy, white-tipped orange tail is visible on the right side of the frame, emerging from behind the fox's body. The overall impression is one of innocence and charm, characteristic of a storybook character.
