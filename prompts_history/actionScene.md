Configure character01 (the person holding the sword) and character02 (the person sitting) to match the actions in scene01.

Character01 is shown holding the sword on the right and making a kicking motion, while character02 is on the left, defending against the kick. This pose is suitable for martial arts.

The action scene is a composite of the two characters.
