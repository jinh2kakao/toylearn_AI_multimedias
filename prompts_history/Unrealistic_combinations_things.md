Please keep the attached image of the car as close to the original as possible, creating an image of a future electric car in 2050 with mechanical legs, similar to those of a horse, instead of wheels.
```
```
Change the background to a running horse, similar to the one in the attached image. A landscape often used in car advertising would be ideal.
```
```
The car should be in front of the horse, making it stand out and in focus.
```
```
The landscape should be a winding mountain landscape with a refreshing asphalt road.
```
```
Express it with power and dynamics.
```
```
Please include advertising text for the car in the image.
Use a magazine-style text for the text.
Please suggest advertising text that emphasizes the car's power, speed, and ride quality.
```
```
Please fill the billboard with the advertisement image created above and place it on the attached image.
